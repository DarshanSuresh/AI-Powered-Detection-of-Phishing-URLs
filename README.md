# AI-Powered Detection of Phishing URLs
 
## Project Overview
 
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises 11,054 instances with 32 features related to website characteristics, including HTTPS presence, subdomains, and various URL attributes. The goal was to build a model capable of accurately classifying websites as either phishing or legitimate.

## Key Tasks

### Data Loading and Preparation
- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
- Conducted initial data exploration to understand the dataset structure.
- Addressed missing values and data type inconsistencies.
- Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant columns to enhance data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed EDA to examine data distributions and identify class imbalances.
- Analyzed feature distributions and value counts to detect patterns and anomalies.

### Feature Engineering and Selection
- Selected relevant features for model training and removed redundant ones.
- Managed class imbalance to improve model performance.

### Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio for evaluation purposes.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Developed machine learning models to classify websites as phishing or legitimate.
- Assessed model performance using various evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Outcome

The project successfully developed a phishing detection model, highlighting expertise in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. The work demonstrates the ability to address real-world data challenges and provides solutions for enhancing cybersecurity.
